                <p>I had my first college programming class in '76, while in 5th grade. I've been writing software professionally since age 17, that being 1982. 
				   It was during high school of '82 I founded a video game studio for the <b>Vic-20</b> and the <b>Commodore 64</b> home computers. We called  
				   ourselves <em>EathenRoss Software</em>, my best friend Chris Ross and I. That first image in the upper left was our <em>The Grave Cave</em> 
				   game for the Vic-20. We had games nation wide in <b>Sears</b> and <b>K-Mart</b> the holiday season of 1982. I wrote the software, Chris got
				   our destribution deal, and we both made the packaging and shrink wrapped the games ourselves.  
                   That high school game studio was a lot of ambitious and crazy teen energy exposing me to the larger world of professional technology 
                   and business. Lessons that proved to be very useful later...
                </p>
                <p>
                   I was one of the original pre-release <b>Apple Macintosh</b> developers, and still have a <em>mimeographed while being authored</em> version 
				   of <b>Inside Macintosh</b> with hand scribbled notes from the Apple OS developers. I was a member of the 80's 3D graphics research
                   community, where one of my roles was working for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot">Benoit Mandelbrot</a> on his original
				   research publication of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beauty_of_Fractals">Fractal Mathmatics</a>. Working at the Boston University
				   3D Graphics Lab exposed me to scientific visualization work, the foundations of formal 3D computer animation, and my first formal work writing
				   artificial intelligence. The 4th image, top row is some 3D renderings from my Boston 3D Graphics days: in that image the top is a motion blurred 
				   yellow sphere in a reflective fractal cube, middle are some fractal cracked platonic solids, and the bottom part is an AI Simulation language 
				   that was my senior thesis.
				</p>
				<p>
				   After undergrad, I became an R&D era developer of CD-ROMs for Philips Media. There I authored an interactive documentary production system, 
				   and then technically led a team creating 13 different 7+ hour art history documentaries, each repeat produced in 8 languages. After that I 
				   became OS team member of both the 3D0 and the original PlayStation 3D game consoles. Recruited by Electronic Arts before the 3D0 spinout, I 
				   wrote the original version of the 3D0 video subsystem, as well as was a team member of <em>Road Rash 3D0</em>. As the 3D0 failed, I became 
				   <b>Sony Computer Entertainment of N. America's</b> first software developer, promptly shipped off to Tokyo to work on the finalizing of the 
				   PSX OS. 
				</p>
				<p>
				   Over the 90's I worked on over 36 multmedia and/or 3D video game titles (including <b>Tiger Woods Golf</b>, <b>NCAA Football</b>, 
				   <b>Brunswick Bowling</b> and more). As the 90's closed I became Director of Skunkworks for the Internet's first <b>Live Video Infrastructure 
					Provider</b>; as one of the pioneers of <b>Live Internet Video</b> <em>five years before YouTube</em> I wrote code and produced live talk shows.
				</p>
				<p>
                   After the domcom crash, I worked as a triplicate <em>digital artist / software engineer / financial analysis</em> for an <b>Academy Award</b> 
				   winning VFX studio across nine VFX heavy major release feature films. While working in VFX, I also earned a double majored MBA in Finance and 
				   International Business. My Master's Thesis is in and I am a global patent author for <em>Automated Actor Replacement in Filmed Media</em>. 
                   Acquiring a <em>global patent</em> is a story in itself. 
                </p>
                <p>
                   I attempted to create a new form of advertising with my patent. I envisioned <em>Personalized Video Advertising</em> where you, your family 
                   and friends appear in the video adverts streamed to your Internet devices. I launched a startup with fellow VFX veterans and built a complete 
                   broadcast quality <b>automated actor replacement pipeline</b> and <b>automatic photo-real digital double creation service</b>. 
                   However, launching during 2008's financial crisis and a good number of years before general public awareness of
                   <em>deep fake technology</em>, financing was unrealizable and a pivot to the video game industry could not save the company. 
                   From the experience of my startup, I gained the interest of a leading <b>Facial Recognition Developer</b>. I became the lead engineer of their 
                   flagship product through three generations, earning top 5 placements in the annual <b>NIST Facial Recognition Vendor's Test</b> each year 
                   participating. That last image, lower right last row describes the Aureus3D-AI facial recognition software.
