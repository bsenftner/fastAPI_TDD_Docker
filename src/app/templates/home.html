                <p>I've been writing software professionally since age 17, which was way back in '82. During highschool I founded a video game studio 
                    for the <b>Vic-20</b> and the <b>Commodore 64</b> home computers. We had games nation wide in <b>Sears</b> and <b>K-Mart</b> the 
                    holiday season of 1982. 
                    That high school game studio was a lot of ambitious and crazy teen energy exposing me to the larger world of professional technology 
                    and business. Lessons that proved to be very useful later...
                </p>
                <p>
                   Since that time I have been one of the original pre-release <b>Apple Macintosh</b> developers, a member of the 80's 3D graphics research
                   community, an R&D era developer of CD-ROMs, OS team member of multiple 3D game consoles, team or lead of over 36 media rich multmedia
                   and/or 3D video game titles (including <b>Tiger Woods Golf</b>, <b>NCAA Football</b>, <b>Brunswick Bowling</b> and more). 
                   As Director of Skunkworks for the Internet's first <b>Live Video Infrastructure Provider</b>, I was one of the pioneers of 
                   <b>Live Internet Video</b> <em>five years before YouTube.</em>
                   I worked as a triplicate <em>digital artist / software engineer / financial analysis</em> for an <b>Academy Award</b> winning VFX studio
                   across nine VFX heavy major release feature films. While working in VFX, I also earned a double majored MBA in Finance and International Business.
                   My Master's Thesis is in and I am a global patent author for <em>Automated Actor Replacement in Filmed Media</em>. 
                   Acquiring a <em>global patent</em>is a story in itself. 
                </p>
                <p>
                   I attempted to create a new form of advertising with my patent. I envisioned <em>Personalized Video Advertising</em> where you, your family 
                   and friends appear in the video adverts streamed to your Internet devices. I launched a startup with fellow VFX veterans and built a complete 
                   broadcast quality <b>automated actor replacement pipeline</b> and <b>automatic photo-real digital double creation service</b>. 
                   However, launching during 2008's financial crisis and a good number of years before general public awareness of
                   <em>deep fake technology</em>, financing was unrealizable and a pivot to the video game industry could not save the company. 
                   From the experience of my startup, I gained the interest of a leading <b>Facial Recognition Developer</b>. I became the lead engineer of their 
                   flagship product through three generations, earning top 5 placements in the annual <b>NIST Facial Recognition Vendor's Test</b> each year 
                   participating. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the course of my career I worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot">Benoit Mandelbrot</a> on his original 
                    research publication on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beauty_of_Fractals">Fractal Mathmatics</a>. 
                    I was at <b>Electronic Arts</b> during their first <em>E.A. Spouse Era</em>, and have some quiet interesting stories about the <b>cut throat</b>
                    video games industry. This was during the creation of the <em>3D0 game console</em>, as well as a few years afterward working as a 3rd party 
                    developer for E.A..
                    I was the first software engineer hire at <b>Sony Computer Entertainment of N. America</b>. In that role I worked in Tokyo with the 
                    <b>original PlayStation OS team</b> during the PSX's pre-release period as the OS and runtime libraries were finalized. 
                    I was the <em>streaming media expert</em> with prior experience at <b>Philips Media</b> and their <em>failed interactive CD-I project</em>. 
                </p>
                <p>A brief word about my <em>Mad Computer Scientist</em> slogan: my being a <em>Mad Computer Scientist</em> is not as in 
                   "I want to take over the world" nor is as in "I'm a conspircy enthusiast".
                   My being a <em>Mad Computer Scientist</em> is more like <em>Mad Magazine</em> and a general appreciation for satire, the more poltical the better. ;P
